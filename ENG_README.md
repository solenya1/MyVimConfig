# MyVimConfig :green_book:

This repository has the settings I like to use in vim/NeoVim.

1. [Installer Plugin](#plugin-installer)
1. [Plugins](#plugins)
1. [ColorScheme](#colorscheme)

## Plugin Installer :gear:

I use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), as it is more practical and easy to use, remembering that if you use vim the Vundle Plugins should be added to your `~/.vimrc` file, but if you use NeoVim the file is called `~/.init.vim`.

## Plugins :wrench:

Lately I'm using it:

[Vim-Polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot)

An excellent Plugin that greatly improves the syntax of Python within Vim. 

[Vim-Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

Plugin that makes the vim status bar more intuitive and elegant. Very nice to use, even more for those who are now starting to use Vim, for indicating when Vim is in Normal mode , insert mode or visual mode. It has several [themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

[Vim-Markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown)

It is a highlight plugin for `.md' files inside Vim.


## ColorScheme :art:

My color configuration is done using [Gogh](https://github.com/Mayccoll/Gogh) in a custom color configuration that I created based on the colors that [George Hotz](geohot.com) uses in his terminal.

All Colorscheme installation tutorial you can access at [themes](https://github.com/solenya1/MyVimConfig/blob/master/themes/tutorial.md).
It is worth mentioning that George uses MacOs so the Shell settings are a little different.

If you want to check the original configuration you can find it in his own repository at [geohot/configuration](https://github.com/geohot/configuration).
